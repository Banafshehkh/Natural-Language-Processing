Failure of diagnose can cause a lot of problems. In a perfect world, when you are sick, hurt, or suffering from health complications, a doctor or other medical professional will be completely accurate in diagnosing sickness or suffer from health complications and lead to the right treatment plan. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. If any mistakes involve misdiagnosing a health condition, patients can suffer serious consequences such as a prolonged condition, further complications, ineffective treatment, or even death. The main goal for this project is to find the similarity of symptoms for different diseases and categorize them to help doctors and patients to understand the possibility of medical misdiagnosis.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105016035/222549612-86b4b3bb-4a9c-4bf2-9632-065d6a8baaf5.png)
